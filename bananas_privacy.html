  <h2>1. Data Collection</h2>
  <p>This GPT-based assistant may process inputs such as clone IDs, trading metadata, or session information if such data is shared during usage. No user-identifying personal data is collected intentionally.</p>

  <h2>2. Data Usage</h2>
  <p>All data is used strictly for the purpose of assisting with infrastructure development, code generation, system logging, and other backend engineering tasks for the Bananas project.</p>

  <h2>3. Data Storage</h2>
  <p>No data from this GPT is stored or used outside of the active session. Inputs and results are ephemeral unless manually logged or routed by the user to an external endpoint.</p>

  <h2>4. Third-Party Access</h2>
  <p>No user data is sold or shared with third parties. This assistant does not interact with advertising networks or analytics providers.</p>

  <h2>5. API Interaction</h2>
  <p>If API Actions are enabled, inputs may be sent to a private API endpoint hosted by the project owner. These endpoints do not store identifying data and exist solely for backend development.</p>

  <h2>6. User Responsibility</h2>
  <p>Users are responsible for avoiding the entry of sensitive or personal information. This system is not intended for public use or financial decision-making at this time.</p>
